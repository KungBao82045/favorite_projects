About:
- When you run 'main.py', you can instruct your drone by showing your hand commands. Depends on what fingers you lift from your palm. If you want to takeoff your drone, show it your open hands. 

Requirements:
- You need a drone that supports Software Development Kit (SDK). If you are a beginner, then I would recommend DJI Ryze Tello. It's easy to use, affordable, and a good start for learning how to operate a drone.
- You need to install a library called 'djitellopy' before using this project. 

Recommended:
- Use PyCharm for better performance compared to VSCode.
