About:
- When you run 'main.py', you can instruct your drone by showing your hand commands. Depends on what fingers you lift from your palm. If you want to takeoff your drone, show it your open hands. 

Requirements:
- You need a drone that supports Software Development Kit (SDK). If you are a beginner, then I would recommend DJI Ryze Tello. It's easy to use, affordable, and a good start for learning how to operate a drone.
- You need to install a library called 'djitellopy' before using this project. 

Pro tips to prevent unwanted drift:
- Make sure to have good lightning in your room.
- If your floor is reflective, cover it with carpet to prevent confusing your drone sensors.
