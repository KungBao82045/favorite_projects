About:
- This is an Arduino project. How it work is when someone tries to open my door, the cable attached on the door will detach from the other cables connected to the Arduino Nano, causing it to trigger an alarm sound because there are no volts flowing from a to b.  
- Currently, I don't have a circuit to show you how it works. Maybe next time.
